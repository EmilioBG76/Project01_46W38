## Variables
# Power output P [MW]
# Wind speed at hub height v [m/s]
# Cp power coefficient that itself is a function of the v
# Rotor area of the turbine A [m2]
# Power rated of the turbine Prated [MW]
# Cut-in wind speed that denotes the minimal wind speed the turbine starts to 
# generate power v_in [m/s] 
# Cut-out wind speed that denotes the wind speed the turbine stops generating 
# power v_out [m/s]
# Rated wind speed that denotes the wind speed the turbine reaches the rated 
# power v_rated [m/s]
# Weighting function g(v) denotes the ratio of generated power to the rated power
# For linear interpolation g(v)=(v−v_in)/(v_rated−vin)
# For cubic interpolation g(v)=v^3/v^3_rated

## Write a function to calculate the power output by implementing the model 
# defined in the last section. 
# Your function need to fullfil the following requirements:
# - wind speed (we assume it will be a float number)
# - rated power, with a default value: 15,
# - cut-in wind speed, with a default value: 3,
# - rated wind speed, with a default value: 11,
# - cut-out wind speed, with a default value: 25,
# - interpolation option, a string to define the interpolation method, can only be
# - "linear" or "cubic", with a default value: "linear".
